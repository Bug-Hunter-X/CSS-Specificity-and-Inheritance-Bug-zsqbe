The solution addresses the specificity issue by ensuring that the style for `div p` has higher specificity than the styles for `div` and `p`:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green !important; /* Use !important to ensure the rule overrides all others */
}
```

Using `!important` is generally discouraged for maintainability reasons, but it provides a clear demonstration for achieving the desired override in this specific case.  A better solution might involve restructuring the CSS to ensure higher specificity without `!important`, for instance, by using more specific selectors if possible.
