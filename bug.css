The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is intended to override both the div and p rules */
}

/* The intended behavior is for the text inside a <p> element nested within a <div> element to be green. However, due to specificity, the color might not be as expected */
```

This issue arises when the specificity of CSS rules is not handled correctly. If the div p selector inherits the specificity of the div selector, then the green color may not override the red color.  The specificity of the div p selector is higher than the p selector. But, It's still lower than the specificity of the div selector if specificity is inherited.
